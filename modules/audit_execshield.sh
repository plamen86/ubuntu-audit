# audit_execshield
#
# Execshield is made up of a number of kernel features to provide protection
# against buffer overflow attacks. These features include prevention of
# execution in memory data space, and special handling of text buffers.
#
# Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks
# enhances the security of the system.
