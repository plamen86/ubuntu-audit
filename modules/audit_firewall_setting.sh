# audit_firewall_setting
#
# Apple's firewall will protect your computer from certain incoming attacks.
# Apple offers three firewall options: Allow all, Allow only essential, and
# Allow access for specific incoming connections. Unless you have a specific
# need to allow incoming connection (for services such as SSH, file sharing,
# or web services), set the firewall to "Allow only essential services,"
# otherwise use the "allow access for specific incoming connections" option.
#
# 0 = off
# 1 = on for specific services
# 2 = on for essential services
